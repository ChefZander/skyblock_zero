# Skyblock: Zero
Start from absolutely nothing in a skyblock world. Time is your resource. Get lost in the ambiance. Space is your canvas.<br>

## Playing
There is an in-game Quest Book to get you started. Have fun!<br>
- **Please report bugs in the package threads, i will fix them ASAP.**

I have included a CHANGELOG.md with the download for those interested.
