- mesecons_mvps is an SBZ mod, not part of mesecons, was not part of mesecons, its just named that way for dependancies
- if you find any error/dead link in this information, make an issue or a pull request correcting it
- some of the information was gotten from `README` files of projects, not the `LICENSE` files
- `*?` - For FSF licenses, i didn't/couldn't find out if it's -only or -or-later, assume `-only`
- this list is sorted by: 
    - the "permissiveness" of a license (so GNU licenses go above MIT for example)
    - if the work is modified, it goes above all else
    - reasoning: GNU/Apache licenses require extra stuff when modified, and even modified permissive mods still require checking if media licenses are correct

Mods that would be good to submodule with git history in the future (as they may receive updates that could be easily pulled and their modifications are fairly small):
- smartshop
- player_monoids
- travelnet
- replacer
- vizlib (maybe upstream that modification? it was just one line from the little i remember)

### Contributing
- When contributing, make sure to respect media licenses

### Direction
- Make luacontrollers better
- Switch away from, or heavily modify signs_lib, without being backwards incompatible with signs from previous versions of sbz
    - Things like rendering text without it being on a sign is impossible i think? which is horrible
- Rely more on stubes than pipeworks
