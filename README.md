# Skyblock: Zero
Start from absolutely nothing in a skyblock world. Time is your resource. Get lost in the ambiance. Space is your canvas.<br>

For ContentDB users: This package includes this exact information in its `README.md` file. So you can read it locally at your own leisure.

## Copyright and Licensing
"Third party mods" refer to mods or modpacks originally created outside of Skyblock: Zero included as git submodules or forks. Some of these third party mods did not credit all of the involved people in the work itself, preferring to point at the git history. This is not changed, following the authors' wishes. Forked/Modified third party mods usually have some code and assets replaced or removed from the original mod hence those code/assets are detached completely from the original mod's licensing.

Generally, source code of original Skyblock: Zero mods are licensed under GPL-3.0-only by various contributors. Source code of third party mods has changes under the same license as the original work. Skyblock: Zero as a whole is necessarily conveyed in GPL-3.0-only; the third party mods keep their original licenses within this work.

Images, sounds and 3D models collectively referred to as *assets* or *media* introduced for Skyblock: Zero are licensed under a Creative Commons license or the same license of the original work. The most restrictive media license is CC BY-SA 4.0 and CC BY-SA 3.0.

"Technical changes" refer to *strictly functional, non-transformative changes* as opposed to transformative changes that would be *eligible* for copyright. Examples includes minor text reformatting, typo fixes, indentation changes, size optimizations, file format transcoding, near lossless transformations, and metadata stripping. These changes are not mentioned, assumed that  technical changes have occurred.

In each both original mods and forked third party mods, there is a `COPYRIGHT.md` file containing more detailed copyright information.

- 🔴 means the mod features risky/improper licensing of a category of work. e.g. images licensed as GPL-3.0 make little sense is generally risky to use.
- If you find any copyright information errors/inaccuracies, please make an issue or a pull request correcting it.
- Table sorted by this logic:
  1. Modified work is prioritized.
  2. More restrictive source code licenses are prioritized.

Candidates to convert into submodules instead of maintaining forks with small modifications:
- travelnet: potentially
- player_monoids: likely
- replacer: likely
- signs_lib: potentially replaced
- smartshop: potentially
- hbsprint: potentially
- voxelmodel: i only care about the voxelmodel.obj, and the texture files for fun luacontroller activities (so that they dont have to be imported as png base64)
- screwdriver: it was only a texture/recipe change, so potentially
- vizlib: yes (theres just one trivial change)

## Contributing
When contributing, ensure copyright information is added in your contribution and to comply with the licenses of other people's work if used. If unsure, you may ask for help :)

## Direction
- Make luacontrollers better
- Switch away from, or heavily modify signs_lib, without being backwards incompatible with signs from previous versions of sbz
    - Things like rendering text without it being on a sign is impossible i think? which is horrible
- Rely more on stubes than pipeworks
