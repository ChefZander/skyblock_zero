Status: $AUTOHOOK_ENABLED$

When autohook is enabled, when a luacontroller takes too much time to execute before yielding, instead of throwing an error, the debug hook will instead yield.

<b>(small) Downsides</b>
What this means in practice, that you don't have to have pointless <mono>wait(0)</mono> calls anymore, as autohook will simply yield automatically. However, there are unyieldable places such as <mono>return x, y, z</mono> or <mono>table.sort(x, function() ... end)</mono>. To prevent you from abusing this, autohook will respect this limitation at most 10 times. Afterwards, it'll forcefully yield it. This is a very rare error, so it's impractical to try abusing this error.

Also, autohook works only with luajit, but this isn't a problem as skyblock zero requires luajit to run anyway (what 99.9% of people have).


<b>How do i enable it? (For server admins/singleplayer world owners)</b>
Please read the <mono>README.md</mono> document inside <mono><skyblock_zero>/mods/libox/autohook/README.md</mono> for instructions making autohook available.
