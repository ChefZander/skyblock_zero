<big>Buttons and Toggles</big>
You can send a button "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" events depending on what you want, to receive events from the button

They will take in the form of a boolean saying true (always).

As for toggles, if you send them any event they will send over their status (either true or nil) and the player can toggle them.
