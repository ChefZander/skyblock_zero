<bigger> Luacontroller Basics </bigger>
Luacontrollers execute sandboxed lua code, they can be used for controlling machines or "logic devices".

Skyblock Zero's luacontrollers are very different than mesecon's luacontrollers. (But everything possible with mesecon's luacontrollers should be possible with skyblock zero's luacontrollers, besides interacting with mesecon wire or digilines, as those don't exist in skyblock zero)
They are built to solve complex problems, and be customizable, sometimes at the cost of setting it up.

You have to be familiar with lua 5.1 to use them.

By default the luacontroller won't do anything.
To be able to edit the luacontroller's code, you need to get the editor system disk.

If you click the luacontroller with the editor system disk (will be reffered to as "punching editor" here), it will deploy the disk's editor code to the luacontroller,
so if you right click the luacontroller, an editor should appear.

If there are any errors in the <b>editor</b> code, they will be displayed in the infotext (infotext is that text that appears when you hover a block).
But if there are any errors in the <b>main</b> code, they should be displayed by the editor.

Setting up the luacontroller is also more cleanly covered in the Getting Started page.

Editor code - Code that's responsible for the editor
Main code - Code that actually does the thing you want to achieve with the luacontroller

<bigger>Compute Limits</bigger>

To not cause any harm to the server, or accidental infinite loops, the execution time of the luacontroller is limited.

The editor is limited to $EDITOR_MS_LIMIT$ miliseconds per event (e.g. when someone clicks on a button, you have this amoutn of miliseconds to process that).
The main code is limited to $MAIN_MS_LIMIT$ miliseconds without yielding.
There is no hard limit on how many events per second you can have but there is a limit on how much server resources you can use up per second.
So if main code and editor take up more than $COMBINED_MS_LIMIT$ miliseconds, per second, the sandbox won't be able to receive events (including editor) until the next second passes.

For each milisecond the luacontroller takes, it gets billed 4 power. The luacontroller won't function until the bill is paid.

<bigger>Main Code</bigger>

The main code gets executed inside a coroutine, and you can <b>yield</b> it. (Kinda like pausing it)

<mono>event = yield(...)</mono>

Thanks to luajit, you can yield anywhere.
Example: <mono>
$C1i = 0
$C1local function yield_if_needed()
$C1    i = i + 1
$C1    if i == 5 then
$C1        _missed_events = wait(0.1) -- this function internally calls yield
$C1        i = 0
$C1    end
$C1end
$C1
$C1for x = 1,100 do
$C1    for y = 1,100 do
$C1        for z = 1,100 do
$C1            yield_if_needed() -- pauses the sandbox so it doesn't time out
$C1        end
$C1    end
$C1end
</mono>

The main code is turned on/off by the editor, or it can be turned on by a <mono>send</mono> event.

You can have up to $MAIN_RAM_LIMIT$ kilobytes in the main sandbox. This may be refered to as the "ram" limit. (all locals, functions, their upvalues, their locals, their functions...)

<bigger>Editor Code</bigger>

Code that's responsible for the editor
Executes very similarly to the mesecons luacontroller. Meaning that instead of yielding, there is a global defined named <mono>event</mono> that has the event.

Only contains a very basic environment, but once the main sandbox is on, it can access that environment directly.

As mentioned earlier, if there is an error with the editor code, it ends up in the infotext.
Both editor and main sandbox receive gui events.

<bigger>Linking</bigger>

Linking range - The radius of the square that you see when you wield the luacontroller linking tool (with the luacontroller linking tool being linked to a luacontroller)
Linking range is usually enforced for doing anything that's in the world (like sending information or getting a node)
To increase linking range (by default 0, <b>by default the luacontroller basically can't do anything</b>), you will need to upgrade the luacontroller with a Linking Upgrade.

A link is an array of positions, like so: { {x=,y=,z=}, {x=,y=,z=}... }
If you want to know where a link is, and there is only one position in the link, do <mono>link[1]</mono>

Some functions may require a link, or they may require a position.
Those functions will usually silently fail if they get a link instead of the position, so to see that error, you can do:

<mono>chat_debug( dump({turn_off_machine(<link or position>)}) )</mono>

You can compare positions using <mono>vector.equals</mono>, or <mono>core.hash_node_position(pos1) == core.hash_node_position(pos2)</mono>
