<big>Formspec Screen</big>

A really simple component but at the same time a really complicated component for newbies to Luanti

If you send a string to it, it will render it as a formspec, see <action name=url url=https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/5.9.0/doc/lua_api.md#formspec>https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/5.9.0/doc/lua_api.md#formspec</action>

How do you get the fields from it when someone clicks??
If you send specifically the string "subscribe", the luacontroller will be subscribed to the formspec screen (only 1 luacontroller per formspec screen), you can send "unsubscribe" to get unsubscribed

When someone clicks something and the luacontroller is subscribed, it will receive a message containing the fields (This is documented in minetest docs under "on_player_receive_fields")
It will also add on a "sender" field with the name of the person that clicked.
