<big>Teleport Tube</big>

You can send it a string, to set the teleport tube's channel.
Or you can send it a table, with <mono>{can_receive = true/false, channel = "" }</mono> to change if it can receive things, and the channel (both fields optional)

<b>Examples</b>

<mono>send_to(links.tptube, {can_receive = false})</mono>
<mono>send_to(links.tptube, "frogTheSecond:matter_dust")</mono>
<mono>send_to(links.tptube, {can_receive = true, channel = "frogTheSecond:matter_dust"})</mono>
