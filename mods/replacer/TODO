-- inspection tool: add button to open unified_inventory's formspec
    this may no longer be as important and isn't that practical as there are
    now so many buttons. It would be hard to keep clear which item will be shown.
    <OgelGames@Discord> SwissalpS: by using player:set_inventory_formspec() unified_inventory
        binds itself to the 'i'-key
        https://github.com/minetest-mods/unified_inventory/blob/d6688872c84417d2f61d6f5e607aea39d78920aa/internal.lua#L302-L306
    <OgelGames@Discord> I think you could open it by sending the formspec from
        unified_inventory.get_formspec(player, page)
    maybe we can use this on group buttons

-- inspection tool:
    stop passing context in hidden fields, use runtime cache to keep
        context -> enables to keep all recipes in cycle and possibly reduce look-ups.
    crafting info on craftable entities like bikes, trains
    figure out how to make the itemstring selectable for copy -> do that with new formspec version
    add mixing method
    add info for plants telling when they are ripe -> allowing user to click on the ripe
        stage and see possible seed drop -> showing info about planting.
        don't forget wine:blue_agave when doing that

-- known incompat replacer ------------------------
-- doors in general (low priority)
 (lowest priority)
-- elphabet: add human readable letter to shortstring mainly for history
-- letters: similar to elphabet

------ replacer fixes --------

try to add a formspec for player to be able to choose from multiple valid drops
    when node does not drop itself.

-- can't be set --> no recipe
homedecor:glass_table_large_square
homedecor:dvd_cd_cabinet
homedecor:chains
homedecor:wood_table_large_square
scifi_nodes:junk
scifi_nodes:engine
scifi_nodes:doomengine
scifi_nodes:crate
scifi_nodes:capsule2
scifi_nodes:capsule3
scifi_nodes:builder

-- can be set but can't be placed -- need alias for inspect tool too
-- these seem to work now, maybe placing them with place_all isn't good simulation?
homedecor:desk_lamp_7 -> 14
homedecor:ceiling_lantern_6 -> 14
homedecor:ceiling_lamp_8|on -> 14
homedecor:glowlight_half_8|on -> 14
homedecor:glowlight_quarter_0|on -> 14
homedecor:glowlight_small_cube_1|on -> 14
homedecor:ground_lantern_0-13|on homedecor:ground_lantern_14
homedecor:hanging_lantern_10|on -> 14
homedecor:lattice_lantern_large_1|on -> 14
homedecor:lattice_lantern_small_1
homedecor:plasma_ball_off -> homedecor:plasma_ball_on -- meh
homedecor:plasma_lamp_8|on -> 14
homedecor:standing_lamp_8
homedecor:table_lamp_12

------- need 'cable plate override' ---------
homedecor:speaker_open -> homedecor:speaker (cable plate overrides) -- not fixing as user can have both in inventory

---------- known incompat inspect -----------

---- missing icons ----
cottages:wool;cottages:wool (used by homedecor:curtain_open) -- meh, there is working recipe
(homedecor:stained_glass) -- cottages:glass_pane_side

-- fix in scifi_nodes
flowers:dandelion --> dandelion_white and dandelion_yellow would exist (*scifi_nodes:plant10 also 9)

-- fix in homedecor_kitchen
homedecor:kitchen_cabinet --> homedecor:kitchen_cabinet_colorable *

-- fix these in bridger mod
bridger:corrugated_steelgreen --> bridger:corrugated_steel_green *
bridger:corrugated_steelwhite
bridger:corrugated_steelred
bridger:corrugated_steelsteel
bridger:corrugated_steelyellow

-- christmas presents say they don't drop anything

-- will not implement --
    add helper so when setting replacer to an itemframe that contains something,
        set to the contents --> but which param values? This isn't a good idea.
    add biofuel hints also general 'fuel' craft types -> if biofuel doesn't expose a list
        this is also doomed (as I don't want to maintain lists)
    add digging method for ores --> maybe not. Doing this dynamically seems overkill to
        check every registered item to see if it drops the requested item
    add info for seeds and saplings about planting -> this too seems like a task that will
        include mainting a list of all plant types of any mod that adds them. Not my intention.
