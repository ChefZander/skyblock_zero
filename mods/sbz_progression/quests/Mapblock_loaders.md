Mapblock loaders

## Mapblock loader

### Text

Imagine you want to create a huge factory that would be self-contained and moreover produce something (like power or resouces) but you don't want to take the entire factory with you using jumpdrives. The mapblock loader is meant just for you!.
You can create it using 4 warp crystals, 4 retaining circuits and one titanium block.
