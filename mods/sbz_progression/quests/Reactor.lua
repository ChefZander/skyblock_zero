Emittrium reactors are another way of generating energy. They are a 3x3x3 cube made of reactor shells (or reactor glass), with a reactor core in the center. Some of the shells must be replaced with a reactor power port, a reactor coolant port, a reactor emittrium port and a reactor infoscreen. It consumes emittrium and water.
If it doesn't have enough coolant (water), it heats up, and bad things happen if it heats up too much.]]
