Digital gold? Where have I heard that before...

### Meta

Requires: 

## Furnace

### Text

Craft the high power electric furnace (H.P.E.F for short), it allows you to smelt any powder into an ingot, ingots are heavily used in crafting recipes.

### Meta

Requires: Crusher

## Simple Alloy Furnace

### Text

Smelts metals into alloys.  
Try out some combinations of metals to see which ones create alloys. Consumes 10 Power when running.

### Meta

Requires: Crusher, Emittrium Circuits, Antimatter, Charged Field

## Bronze Age

### Text

Congratulations, Commander! You've just unlocked the Bronze Age—because nothing says 'cutting-edge space exploration' like struggling to make a metal our ancestors figured out 5,000 years ago. Sure, you've mastered faster-than-light travel, but apparently mixing [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] is still rocket science. Good luck, Space Caveman!

### Meta

Requires: Simple Alloy Furnace, Crusher

## Compressor

### Text

Have you ever wanted to turn your metals into blocks? Now you can!  
Craft this wonderful compressor, insert in 9 powder, or 9 ingots, and watch as it makes your blocks.  
Blocks made from chemicals cannot be dug with matter annihilators, you must use the robotic arm or the drill instead.  

### Meta

Teleport Battery teleports power accross networks. Can be useful when trying to share power with other people.  

### Meta

Requires: Crystal Grower

## Jetpack

### Text

Have you wished to fly? Do i have the tool for you...  
  
The controls:  
  
Left clicking while holding an un-activated jetpack (you can see with the red lighgt on the texture) will activate it.  
Left clicking while holding an activated jetpack (the light becomes green) will de-activate it  
  
When a jetpack is activated:  
If you press/hold jump:  
- jetpack applies upwards velocity to you  
- jetpack wears down a bit  
- you become 2x faster  
If you press/hold both jump and shift or aux1:  
- jetpack applies half as much upwards velocity as when you jump  
- jetpack wears down 2x less  
- you still become 2x faster  
  
The mode you are flying in can also be seen by how many particles are getting spawned.  
The wear is setup such that it lasts you 3 minutes of constant flying  
  
You can re-fuel your jetpack by clicking on a battery, full repair costs 1000 Cj  
  
Jetpack gets de-activated when you move it in your inventory during flight, or when it runs out of charge.  
  
The Jetpack originally used to get automatically de-activated when you stop having it in your hand, but that is no longer the case.

## Bear Arms

### Text

Notice the small little pun there? .. it's obvious that it tells you to craft a Robotic Arm? Oh.

### Meta

Requires: Furnace

## Electric Drill

### Text

The elecric drill has 500 uses and is powered by electricity.  
What does that mean?  
  
If you "place" it on a battery (sneak+right click), it will take power from the battery and charge the drill! (Just like the jetpack)  
It needs 1 power per 1 use.  
  
It also digs 2x faster than the robotic arm.  

### Meta

Requires: Bear Arms

## Antimatter Generators

### Text

Craft the antimatter generator, it is best used with automation or a large array of batteries.  
It needs 1 matter and 1 antimatter per second.  
It's super resource hungy but gives you more power.  

### Meta

Requires: Furnace

## Engraver

### Text

Creates processors from silicon crystals.  

### Meta

Requires: Laser, Crystal Grower

## Info: Multiblock Terminology

### Text

Multiblock - A machine that is made from multiple nodes (blocks).  
Wallsharing - When 2 multiblocks share a wall  
"Forming" a multiblock - Connecting all the nodes of a multiblock to a controller.  
"Breaking" a multiblock - Disconnecting all the nodes of a multiblock, making it not function. This does **not** mean that any of the nodes of the multiblock would be damaged, the multiblock just won't function and will have to be re-formed.  
  
Multiblocks will break when they are moved, or if any of their nodes are broken. This means they are not friendly to jumpdrives and you will have to form them again, this may change in the future.  
The emittrium reactor was made before multiblocks got standardised, so some of this information that is here most likely won't apply to them.  

### Meta

Requires: 

## Blast Furnace

### Text

The blast furnace is a multiblock that allows you to smelt or alloy things very fast.  
It also introduces a special mode that lets you alloy 3 items (required for some recipes), and when using the item input, it won't clog like the alloy furnace.  
  
**Please keep in mind, before making it, have some good ore automation, or you will find crafting it really not fun.**  
  
To get started, craft the blast furnace controller.  
Click/tap on the "Show Build Plan" button to see what nodes the furnace will occupy. The furnace will always face one way relative to the controller.  
Then, choose the amount of heater rows you want. Each heater smelts as fast as a regular furnace, and it will speed up "blast recipes" (recipes that require the blast furnace).  
Then build it :D.  
  
Once you have built it according to the plan, don't forget to replace one machine casing (any machine casing) with one power port.  
Optionally, you can add the item inputs/outputs. The item output will completely dump the destination inventory.  
  
The blast furnace will look like this (the amount of heaters and the placement of the power port, item input and item output can be different):

To complete this quest, craft a blast furnace controller, but be aware that it doesn't end there.

## Phlogiston Fuser

### Text

Chemistry is boring.... what about alchemy!  
To make phlogiston, you'll need lots of power for a very long time, be aware of that.  
You can also make some armor from phlogiston, once it is low on durability, you can charge that armor like you would charge your jetpack.  

### Meta

Requires: Crystal Grower, Very Advanced Batteries

## Planet Teleporter

### Text

**Right**-click with a warp crystal to use. If you left click you will waste it. There are multiple types of planets, with some of them having rings.

### Meta

Requires: Neutronium, Phlogiston Fuser

## Info: Inside of planets

### Text

In the center of a planet, there is a core, around it is some molten metal.  
  
Molten metal reacts with cold nodes (like water and ice), very slowly, to:  
- if flowing molten metal collides with water, it gets tured into stone  
- if a flowing metal source collides with water, it gets turned into the node that the flowing metal was. For example molten silicon =\> silicon block  
  
There is currently no way to make molten metal.  

### Meta

Requires: Planet Teleporter

## Planet Ores

### Text

At the center of planets, there is usually some core material.  
In blue stone there is uranium ore, blue stone is only found in ice planets.  
In red stone there is thorium ore, red stone is found in dead planets and colorium planets.  
To get this achievement, you will need to put uranium or thorium powder in your inventory.  

### Meta

Requires: Planet Teleporter

## Pebble Enhancer

### Text

You'll probably want to get thorium and uranium automatically now, no worries, it's possible.  
Enhanced pebbles can also get you lithium, cobalt, titanium, silicon and silver.  
Simply put a pebble into the pebble enhancer, it will become enhanced.  

### Meta

Requires: Planet Ores

## Decay Accelerator

### Text

It is used to obtain plutonium or lead from radioactive materials (Uranium, thorium, plutonium). Only works with powders.  

### Meta

Requires: Planet Ores

## Radiation Shielding

### Text

Solid charged field or lead blocks shield against radiation. Craft some shielding to complete this quest.

### Meta

Requires: Planet Ores

## Nuclear Reactor

### Text

If you need even more power, you might want to consider nuclear reactors.  
  
Types of fuel rods:  
- thorium: doesn't explode, 800 power  
- uranium: explodes if not given cooling, 2200 power  
- plutonium: must have a sufficent amount **non-radioactive** water sources (not flowing water) near the reactor, it explodes, generates 4800 power  
  
You need at least 6 fuel rods for the reactor to power on.  

### Meta

Requires: Planet Ores, Radiation Shielding
