Alright, this is where it gets complicated, so read carefully.

All plants except moss and algae need to be placed in a habitat in order to grow properly. This means a fully enclosed room with a powered Habitat Regulator placed inside it.
Plants also need three things: water next to the node they're on, heat from nearby light sources, and as much sky access as possible, hence the walls and ceiling of the habitat should be made of glass. If they don't get these things, they'll start to wilt and die instead of growing. So take that into consideration when designing a habitat.]],

So now that you have a habitat, all you've got to do is use some fertilizer on some dirt inside it. Keep trying until you get a sort of purple grass - this is Pyrograss, a hardy yet very flammable monocotyledon. Wait for it to grow to full height and then harvest it.
	
There is one more thing which almost all plants except Pyrograss need: CO2, which they use to photosynthesize. To produce some, simply craft a Burner from Pyrograss and some other stuff. If placed in a habitat this will burn organic items placed inside it to release CO2 into the habitat's atmosphere - no power necessary. Some items are better than others, try out a few and see what works best!]],

Have you dreamed of like... coloring... nodes... or like... having some trees? Yea, you can do those now.
So, how do you grow them:
1) Obtain the sapling
2) Put a strong light source next to it
3) Wait or use fertilizer on it

Unlike plants, it does not need to be inside a habitat regulator.
Achievment will unlock when your tree grows.
