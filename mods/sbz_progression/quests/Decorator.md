# Questline: Decorator

An island with just machines will look very boring! Use the knowledge from the Decorator Questline to spice up your island! These quests are not required for progression, but playing can get boring on an empty, barren, dark island. So don't just ignore this questline, okay? :P

## Compressed Core Dust

You can also craft Antimatter Blobs. They give off extremely faint light and unlock some lighting nodes to light up your island.  
You can also make antimatter versions of some decorational blocks!  
  
Previously, they used to explode when next to regular matter, but with new updates they no longer do.

## CNC Machines

### Text

Do you want shapes that aren't blocks, like stairs or slabs?  
Oh do i have the machine for you!  
  
With a CNC machine you can make all sorts of stairs and slabs....  
Craft one, put in the block of your choosing*, and boom!  
  
*The node needs to be compatible with the CNC machine, it usually will have a grey "You can make stairs with it!" text.
