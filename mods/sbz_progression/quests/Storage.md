# Questline: Storage

Mainly about drawers and storinators.

## Storinators

### Text

Storinators are the solution to clogged up inventories. They have 32 slots of inventory, and function like a chest.  
The more red/green dots the front of a storinator displays, the more full/empty it is.  

### Meta

Requires: Matter Plates, Charged Field, Retaining Circuits

## Better Storinators

### Text

At some point only having 32 slots of storage is not enough.  
You can make more storinators, or you can make an upgraded one.  
Each upgrade adds 1 row and 1 collumn to the inventory space.  
  
To complete this quest, you need to craft the bronze storinator.

## Public Storinators

### Text

Public storinators are like regular storinators but accessible to ANYONE, regardless of protections. You can craft them by just putting any type of storinator in your crafting guide.

## Best Storinators

### Text

Do you have chaos in your storinators, are you struggling to figure out which one is which, do you need labels, but signs get in the way?  
You can use neutronium storinators, they are a little expensive, requiring 4 neutronium, but if you can afford them, they are great for this.

## Drawers

### Text

Do you have some some automation that produces large amounts of 1 type of item?  
Or do you just have large amounts of one item type?  

Drawers will help here, they are like storinators but they can only store a few item types.
They store 3200 items (without upgrades). With upgrades they can store a lot more.  

Drawers also come with 1x2 and 4x4 variants.

## Drawer Upgrades

### Text

Drawers by default store the same amount of items as a storinator, that's a bit boring. What if you could store more?

TIP: The upgrades don't work as you expect them to, if you have 2 bronze upgrades, each bronze upgrade adds an extra 3200 items, it doesn't multiply 3200 by 4 or anything like that.  
TIP: To insert the upgrade into a drawer, you need to right-click the edge of it, or right-click a side that doesn't have the item display.

## Drawer Controller

### Text

I think you have noticed that drawers still may not work so amazingly for automation, the drawer controller is here to solve that.  
If you send it an item with a tube, or manually provide it an item, it will automatically put it in one of the drawers near it.  

For taking out items, you can use a luacontroller, sending an itemstack (a string like "sbz_bio:dirt 100"), and it will try to give you that dirt by injecting it out of itself.
