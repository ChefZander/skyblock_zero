I would recommend to choose the closest one to you, but any Emitter works. Next, you'll need a Matter Annihilator. You can't destroy the Emitters, but you can chip away at them.

Punch your Emitter of choice until it yields some 'Raw Emittrium'. We'll refine the Emittrium later, but for now we just need it in its raw state.

Emitters have a 1/10 chance of producing Raw Emittrium, and a 9/10 chance of just producing the same materials that core does.

Also, if you put a machine next to another machine, it will conduct power to that machine, so you only need power cables in very specific cases (like automation).]],
