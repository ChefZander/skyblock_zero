Let me tell you, they’re the universe’s ultimate prank. You’d think in the vast expanse of space, we’d figure out a way to do away with stairs. But no!
Instead, we have these absurd vertical obstacles that defy both gravity and logic. Picture this: you’re navigating a sleek, futuristic spaceship, zooming through hyperspace, and suddenly—bam!—you’re face-to-face with a stairway.
Not just any stairway, but one that seems to stretch endlessly between levels of the ship. You’re floating in zero-g, and your only choice is to awkwardly flail your way up or down, hoping you don’t collide with the bulkheads.
And what’s with the handrails? They’re always placed at just the wrong height, making it feel like they’re mocking you as you drift by. Oh, you wanted support? Too bad, space cadet!
I swear, every time I encounter these space stairs, I wonder if the game developers just had a sadistic streak. Let’s see how they handle these! We’ve mastered faster-than-light travel, but let’s make sure their biggest challenge is a staircase that defies the laws of physics!
Next time you’re floating through the cosmos and stumble upon these absurd contraptions, just remember: they’re not there to help you—they’re there to remind you that even in the boundless universe, the real challenge is mastering the art of interstellar stair-climbing.]] --[[,
