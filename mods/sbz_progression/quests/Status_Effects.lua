This effect is applied to you when you are holding a node with gravitational properties in your hand, near meteorite attractors/repulsors, the attraction is slower when you have more items in the stack that you are holding.
During this effect, you can't move yourself, and you experience zero gravity.
But you can still jump, and other knockback sources like explosions can still move you, and jetpack moves you too.

And yes, you can go in orbit of the meteorite attractor, it just needs some practice.
