# Questline: Organics

Grow plants and fungi to craft more things and also make your base look really cool.

## Liquid Water

### Text

Crushing pebbles squeezes out a bit of water. You can take advantage of this by crafting some fluid cells and putting them in the crusher output to collect it. Once you've done that, go build a little pool or something. :)

### Meta

Requires: Crusher

## Emittrium Glass

### Text

The other preliminary we need before we can start growing plants is glass. Thankfully it's really easy to craft, it only needs emittrium and antimatter and crafts a lot of glass.

### Meta

Requires: Antimatter, Obtain Emittrium

## Dirt

### Text

If you've followed my instructions and built a pool, you should notice moss beginning to grow around it, and algae on top of it, if there's enough light. Take some of that moss and craft it into dirt.

### Meta

Requires: Liquid Water

## Sprouting Plants

### Text

You'll also need to craft the algae on your pool into fertilizer. This is useful for forcing dormant seeds in dirt to germinate.

### Meta

## Growing Plants

### Text

Alright, this is where it gets complicated, so read carefully.  
  
All plants except moss and algae need to be placed in a habitat in order to grow properly. This means a fully enclosed room with a powered Habitat Regulator placed inside it.  
Plants also need : water next to the node they're on and heat from nearby light sources.  
If they don't get these things, they'll start to wilt and die instead of growing. So take that into consideration when designing a habitat.  
  
Also, you can use the airtight power cable to deliver power to the switching station and make sure to not put things like slabs or stairs in the walls.  
  
**Tip: make the habitat walls out of solid nodes (emittrium glass is one of the cheapest), and airlocks, do not use things like stairs, or meteorite radars in the construction of your habitat. At most, use things that look like solid-full cubes. Also make sure that the habitat regulator isn't inside the wall, but inside the room you built.**

## Fertilized Dirt

### Text

I'm guessing you want to grow plants faster now, don't worry, this is one of the solutions!  
  
The growth of plants above it will be 2x faster, but so will the co2 consumbtion, and you can't fertilize the dirt, you will have to manually place your plant.  

### Meta

Requires: Growing Plants

## Carbon Dioxide

### Text

So now that you have a habitat, all you've got to do is use some fertilizer on some dirt inside it. Keep trying until you get a sort of purple grass - this is Pyrograss, a hardy yet very flammable monocotyledon. Wait for it to grow to full height and then harvest it.  
  
There is one more thing which almost all plants except Pyrograss need: CO2, which they use to photosynthesize. To produce some, simply craft a Burner from Pyrograss and some other stuff. If placed in a habitat this will burn organic items placed inside it to release CO2 into the habitat's atmosphere - no power necessary. Some items are better than others, try out a few and see what works best!  
Keep in mind, the excess co2 produced by the burner will stay in the habitat, so this means you can have a burner running, and it would build up co2 in the habitat.  
If the burner generates more co2 than the habitat can store, it can store a bit of co2 on its own, but it will stop burning when it is storing co2.  
  
The size of the habitat determines how much co2 it can hold.

## Stemfruit

### Text

The only other plant you can get from fertilizing dirt is Stemfruit; you won't need to grow much of these, but due to their unusual genetic instability, they will very easily mutate to other types of plants, even when provided a very small amount of radiation.

### Meta

Requires: Carbon Dioxide

## Basic Neutron Emitter

### Text

There is not enough radiation in the air for plants to mutate on their own, so basic neutron emitter helps them to mutate.  
Fully grown plants don't mutate.  
  
The radiation comming off of the basic neutron emitter is mostly harmless to players, but if there are multiple neutron emitters, that might become a concern, place this node near plants.  

### Meta

Requires: Growing Plants, Neutronium

## Fiberweed

### Text

Unlike the other plants we've met so far, this one lives in the water, and can only be planted on regular dirt.  
It'll keep growing higher and higher until it reaches the surface of the water. Its sturdiness and fibrousness allow it to be crafted into Rope, which may be placed hanging from things to climb down them.  
  
Stemfruit will grow into Fiberweed when placed under water. To grow this plant, make a small area in your habitat with water, at least 3 nodes deep, and at the bottom, place some regular dirt. Then place the stemfruit on the dirt you had underwater, it will sprout into fiberweed.  
It must also be regular dirt, electric soil or fertilized dirt won't be able to grow fiberweed.

## Warpshrooms

### Text

Warpshrooms are used for teleport technology, they grow slightly slower than other plants, and when eaten, they teleport you around.  

### Meta

Requires: Stemfruit, Basic Neutron Emitter

## Shockshrooms

### Text

Shockshrooms are very energetic shrooms, so energetic that they will inflict the "shocked" effect when you step on them, and will generate a small amount of power. (better soil makes it generate more)  
Unlike other plants, they will continue consuming CO2 even after they have completely grown, and will keep generating power.  

### Meta

Requires: Stemfruit, Basic Neutron Emitter

## Cleargrass

### Text

When stepping on cleargrass, you get rid of almost all effects.  
The cleargrass will boost plant growth by 25% when fully grown.  
Unlike other plants, they will continue consuming CO2 even after they have completely grown, and will keep boosting plant growth.  

### Meta

Requires: Stemfruit, Basic Neutron Emitter

## Razorgrass

### Text

When stepping on razorgrass, you will get poisoned.  
It is used for some crafting recipes and fertilizer.  

### Meta

Requires: Stemfruit, Basic Neutron Emitter

## Electric Soil

### Text

Was fertilized dirt too slow? Electric soil should be a good upgrade... or bad... Depending on what you need.  
Electric soil will make plants grow a LOT faster, and consume a LOT more co2, and the electric soil itself needs 40Cj every second to run.  

### Meta

Requires: Shockshrooms

## Airlocks

### Text

Tired of breaking a hole in the wall whenever you want to enter a habitat? Introducing the Airlock: a node which holds in the atmosphere while letting you effortlessly walk through.

### Meta

Requires: Growing Plants, Emittrium Glass

## CO2 Compactors

### Text

I'll assume you want to store a little more carbon dioxide in your habitat, if so CO2 compactors are excellent for that, they store 30 carbon dioxide in one node, so would be equivilent to 30 empty air nodes.

### Meta

Requires: Stemfruit, Airlocks

## Secret: Not Chorus Fruit

### Text

So apparently Warpshrooms make you teleport randomly when you eat them. Dunno if that makes up for how long they take to grow.

### Meta

Requires: 

## TNT

### Text

There are TNT sticks, they are made by compressing 9 pyrograss. These TNT sticks can be thrown and they can be used in combat.  
  
Normal TNT (compressed 9 tnt sticks, 81 pyrograss) can be lit by right clicking it. TNT knocks back entites (regardless of if there is line of sight) and damages entities only if there is line of sight.  
  
To complete this quest, craft a full TNT block.  
  
Also, TNT explosions are delayed if the server is laggy, meaning you can set up 100 000 TNT and it wouldn't be much of an issue. (frog tried this)  

### Meta

## Info: Organics Automation

### Text

I think you want to automate that annoying harvesting of your pyrograss... feeding the burner every day... very boring right!  
Well no worries, node breakers and deployers make plant automation easy.  
  
\<img name=questbook_image_organics_factory.png width=348\>  
Side note: deployers can place 2 nodes ahead, that's a "feature" not a bug.

## Colorium Trees

### Text

Have you dreamed of like... coloring... nodes... or like... having some trees? You can do/have that now.  
So, how do you grow them:  
1) Obtain the sapling  
2) Put a strong light source next to it  
3) Wait or use fertilizer on it  
  
Unlike plants, it does not need to be inside a habitat regulator.  
Achievment will unlock when your tree grows.  
And also, colorium trunks can be used in the burner.  
  
Also, you may see there is a tree core where the sapling used to be, that tree core contains the tree's DNA.  

### Meta

Requires: Neutronium

## Dna Extractor

### Text

So, do you want a different tree?  
1) Put your tree core in the dna extractor  
2) Put your saplings (doesn't matter if they are the default saplings, or already have some dna on them)  
3) Get your new sapling :D  
  
That new sapling, when it grows, it will mutate slightly, so will the tree core.  
You can put that new mutated tree core into the dna extractor, and repeat. After you do this enough times, you will get a tree completely different from the one you started with, you can go sell some tree cores to people too if you got a nice tree (assuming multiplayer) :D  

### Meta

Requires: Colorium Trees

## Colorium Emitters

### Text

Tree farms are difficult, and sometimes needlessly laggy, so colorium emitters were made as a solution.  
When you place them, don't worry, they can be dug.  
They can also be colored, darker colors look weird, you should try them.  
They can drop a sapling, a tree trunk or a leaf.  
  
So... how do you get them....  
They are in the cores of "Colorium Planets", those are the planets with trees and pyrograss.  
Colorium emitters are surrounded by molten metal, so you will need some strong armor (neutronium armor works, may be overkill).  
You will get this quest when you obtain one (possibly will need to move it around in the inventory).  
  
You can duplicate colorium emitters with 8 phlogiston.
