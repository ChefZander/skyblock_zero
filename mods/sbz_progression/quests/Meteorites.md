# Questline: Meteorites


## Meteorites

### Text

By this point you've probably been here for at least an hour. You've almost certainly noticed the funny meteorites that whiz past your core occasionally.  
These are actually a source of metal as well. If you can stop them, which is really hard when you don't know where they're going. But with the alloys you've got, you can craft a **Meteorite Radar**, which shows you their trajectory and makes them much easier to catch.  
When there is no meteorite nearby, it will do nothing. It'll probably still take a few tries though. When meteorites explode, they will turn into neutronium and some meteoric matter, all meteoric matter decays after a hour. Neutronium or strange matter do not decay.

TIP: The meteorite radar consumes **40 Cj** when a meteorite is nearby, but it will consume only **10 Cj** if it can't detect a meteorite. Be sure to have a battery when using it.

### Meta

Requires: Simple Alloy Furnace, Emittrium Circuits

## Laser

### Text

The laser is a tool that allows you to shoot down meteorites from far away. It is useful if you have trouble bridging/jumping to meteorites.

To charge the laser, "place it" into a battery. (right-click the battery with it in your hand)  
It also does some damage to other players if PVP is enabled.  

### Meta

Requires: Simple Alloy Furnace, Emittrium Circuits

## Neutronium

### Text

In the core of a meteorite, you can find a single piece of very dense matter called Neutronium. It's so dense that you can craft it into a Gravitational Attractor, which attracts other passing meteorites and gets you even more metal, or a Gravitational Repulsor which drives them away.  
To complete this quest, make a Gravitational attractor.

### Meta

Requires: Meteorites

## Antineutronium

### Text

Sometimes, meteorites whizzing by will be made of antimatter instead of regular matter. These meteorites have Antineutronium in their core.  
Antineutronium can be crafted into a Gravitational Repulsor, which repulses meteorites.  

To complete this quest, make a Gravitational Repulsor.
  
TIP: Build a shield out of compressed core dust to protect against antimatter meteorites.

### Meta

Requires: Meteorites

## Meteorite Maker

### Text

Makes... meteorites... (no way), also it needs some space on top of it.  
But it cannot make strange matter meteorites.  
  
Tip: By far, the fastest meteorite to mass produce is the emitter meteorite.  
Tip: Meteorites don't really explode in protected areas, you'll have to lure it into an open or unprotected area.  

### Meta

Requires: Autocrafters, Neutronium

## It's strange...

### Text

Strange matter can spread to both matter and antimatter.
  
Strange matter won't spread to "charged" nodes or machines, or protected areas.  
So it's best to protect your area, even if you are in singleplayer, to defend against strange matter.  
  
Strange matter meteorites spawn if you are 100 nodes away from the core.  

### Meta

Requires: Neutronium

## Strange Blob Cleaner

### Text

Restores what was destroyed by strange blobs.
