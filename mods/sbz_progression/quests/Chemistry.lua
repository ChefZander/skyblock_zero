Have you wished to fly? Do i have the tool for you...

The controls:

Left clicking an un-activated jetpack (you can see with the red lighgt on the texture) will activate it.
Left clicking an activated jetpack (the light becomes green) will de-activate it

When a jetpack is activated:
If you press jump:
- jetpack applies upwards velocity to you
- jetpack wears down a bit
- you become 2x faster
If you press both jump and shift or aux1:
- jetpack applies half as much upwards velocity as when you jump
- jetpack wears down 2x less
- you still become 2x faster

The mode you are flying in can also be seen by how many particles are getting spawned.
The wear is setup such that it lasts you 3 minutes of constant flying

You can re-fuel your jetpack by clicking on a battery, full repair costs 1000 Cj

Jetpack gets automatically de-activated when you stop having it in your hand or it runs out of wear

Do you think that the robotic arm is too fragile, or do you want to  dig and have your tool not break as easily?
Electric drill is the tool for you!!!

It has 500 uses and powered by electricity!
What does that mean?

If you "place" it on a battery (sneak+left click/tap), it will take power from the battery and charge the drill! (Just like the jetpack)
It needs 1 power per 1 use.

It also digs 2x faster than the robotic arm.

Be aware, strange matter can... spread... to both matter and antimatter...

Strange matter meteorites spawn if you are 100 nodes away from the core.
