Have you ever been tired of taking items out of nodes? Do you just want to interact with tubes as soon as possible?
Now you can!
The Automatic Filter-Injector takes stacks of items from nodes, and places them into tubes or other nodes.

<big>The Automatic Filter-Injector has two settings:</big>
<b>The slot sequence (allows you to change the order that items are taken out):</b>
Priority: Takes items out in first out order
Randomly: Takes items out in a random order
Rotation: Takes items out in a round-robin order
<b>The match mode (sets the behavior when taking out items):</b>
Exact match - off: If an item matches the filter, it takes out the whole stack
Exact match - on: If an item matches the filter and the stack are higher it takes out the filter count, for example the filter is set to 5 matter, and it is pulling from a stack of 60 matter it will pull out 5 matter until the stack is below 5 or empty
Threshold: If an item matches the filter and the stack are higher it takes out items until the stack matches the filter, so I have a filter of 5 matter and a stack of 60 it will pull 55 matter out of the stack.

Tubes break when they have too many stacks in them. This may not appear as a problem at first, but when you think about it - it can be a huge issue.
<b>If we have this setup:</b>
<img name=questbook_image_basic_setup.png>
Then, there might be an issue with it if the storinator that we are putting items to is completely filled.
In cases where there is only one tube, the item will simply drop, but when there are at least 2 tubes, the items will wonder around, until eventually there will be too many of them. In that case, the tubes will break.

How do we prevent our tubes breaking, or items dropping?
Well... a simple answer would be to have more storinators :D... but that's not practical

<b>Instead, consider using item voids like this:</b>
<img name=questbook_image_overflow_handling.png>
Item voids have the lowest priority, so items really don't want to go there.
Storinator, has a higher priority than the item void, so if the storinator isn't full, items will go there.
Item voids, have a lower priority, so if the item can't go to the storinator, it will go into the item void.

The default priority is 100.

Instatubes are tubes that are instant. They are generally less laggy than their regular pipeworks tube counterparts.

Instatubes work a bit differently than regular tubes.
They internally create a list of all the receivers, then they will sort the receivers based on priority, and the receivers with largest priority will be given the items first, if they are full, it will move on with the receiver with lower priority.
This is different to regular pipeworks tubes... in a way... that's hard to explain, so a visual example would be best:
<img name=questbook_image_instatubes_vs_pipeworks_tubes.png>
Suppose that the green storinators had a priority of 99. (they don't, but it will make explaining this easier) That is higher than regular pipeworks tubes, but lower than regular storinators.
In that case, with the default pipeworks tubes, the items will flow first to the green storinator, then once it's full, it will flow to the regular storinator.
Instatubes work a bit differently, they will choose the storinator with the highest priority, then to the lowest. So items would flow first into the regular storinator, once that's full, it will flow to the green storinator.

Overflow handling: simply put up an item void connected to the instatubes (might need to connect it to a few low priority tubes if you use those anywhere, as it has only a priority of one, and you can go below that)

Now... some things are just impossible with the basic instatube, so there are more types of instatubes :D, this will cover them

<big>Priority Instatubes</big>
(Low priority instatubes, high priority instatubes)

They change the priority of all the machines on their "branch", to explain this better, here it is visually:
<img name=questbook_image_instatube_priority.png width=450>

<big>Teleport Instatube</big>
It teleports items... But isn't quite the same as using the pipeworks instatube, because teleport instatubes will check out all teleport instatubes, and give the item to the highest priority receiver, instead of just sending items to one randomly.

<big>Cycling Input Instatube</big>
This instatube is only useful when placed to something that outputs items (example: filter injectors and blast furnace output ports).
It will completely ignore the priority of the receivers, instead just cycling between them.

<big>Randomized Input Instatube</big>
Like the cycling input instatube but it just gives one random receiver the item

<big>Instatube Item Filter</big>
Similar to the item sorter, but it only governs what can pass through that tube. (The advantage of using it over item sorters is that it will respect priority, and also no short lived entities will get created)

<big>One way instatubes</big>
Instatubes that only allow items flowing from one direction, useful when having multiple filter injectors.

It is a storinator with 16 slots of storage, and 16 slots for the pattern.
The pattern slots govern how the storage slots can be filled. If a pattern has in the first slot 43 matter dust, then there can be only up to 43 matter dust in that slot. Similar to how the autocrafter does it.

By default, filter injector does nothing to the pattern storinator.
When the pattern storinator is full (storage matches the pattern), it will allow using filter injectors, but will disallow inputting items into the pattern storinator.
Once its empty, you will be able to insert to it again, and filter injectors will stop working on it.

The pattern storinator can be used in machines like the meteorite maker, where your flow rate of emittrium and matter blobs might make the meteorite maker clog.
