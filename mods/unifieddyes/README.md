VanessaE's Unified Dyes
=======================

The purpose of this mod originally was to supply a complete set of colors for Minetest mod authors to use for colorized nodes, or to reference in recipes. Since the advent of the default dyes mod in minetest_game, this mod has become more of an extension of the default mod.  Since the advent of param2 colorization, it has also become a library for general color handling.

Unified Dyes expands the standard dye set from 15 colors to 32, 89, or 256 (see the API and usage info).
