# Wrench API
reworked it so its automatic

can_pickup is in node def now, and renamed to wrench_can_pickup

wrench.blacklist_item works as normal, everything else may be nuked, and wrench.plus = nil

but mod is specifically named sbz_wrench so that whatever depends on it doesn't use the wrench api, maybe i will regret that
